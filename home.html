<p class="description"> Korean dramas—K-dramas for short—are South Korean scripted TV shows. Sometimes they’re referred to as Korean soap operas, but that description is misleading because K-dramas actually encompass a wide range of genres, from sci-fi and romance to horror and period pieces and everything in between. Most consist of a finite number of episodes (often between 16 and 24, though some—especially family-oriented and historical dramas—run for 50-plus) and are usually completed in a single season, with a few notable exceptions. K-dramas are generally known for having high production value, intense and often engrossing storylines, and quality acting that helps build an emotional connection between the characters and the audience. They also tend to consist of more PG-friendly fare than western TV shows (nudity and sex are practically nonexistent, for example), rendering K-dramas more palatable for a wider range of age groups and countries. At the same time, the bold and skillful storytelling with which K-dramas tackle societal issues, personal struggles, and universal themes such as family, friendship, and love make for thoughtful content that resonates with audiences across geographical borders. To put it plainly, K-dramas make us feel less alone and often successfully tap into our shared human experiences and emotions. Thanks in large part to streamers like Viki (acquired by Japanese conglomerate Rakuten in 2013) and DramaFever making it possible for viewers to legally watch Korean content online with English subtitles, K-dramas began gaining momentum in the West during the 2010s. These platforms also formed distribution relationships with Netflix and Hulu, which allowed them to reach even more audiences. After Warner Bros., which had acquired DramaFever, abruptly shut down the service in 2018, Netflix began investing heavily in K-dramas and premiered its first Korean original series, the zombie K-drama Kingdom, in January 2019 to great acclaim. Then 2020 happened and turned out to be a milestone year for K-dramas. Viki witnessed its North American subscribers grow by 42 percent between 2019 and 2020, while KOCOWA, which offers exclusively Korean content, also saw its content consumption spike during the same period. Notably, the blockbuster rom-com Crash Landing on You stayed in the top 10 in Japan for a whopping 229 days and was the sixth most-watched TV show on Netflix in the U.S. between March 21 and March 27, 2020. Audiences fell in love with It’s Okay to Not Be Okay, which entered the Netflix top 10 last year in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Nigeria, and Russia, as well as multiple countries in Latin America and Asia. The horror K-drama Sweet Home was watched by 22 million subscribers in its first four weeks on Netflix and was ranked #3 on the platform in the U.S. and globally shortly after its release. Back in 2014, the Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA) released a study estimating that approximately 18 million Americans watched K-dramas. One can only assume that figure is much, much higher now. Stateside, K-dramas have spawned American remakes such as The Good Doctor (now in its fifth season) and inspired a number of online communities on Facebook and Clubhouse. K-dramas have also dramatically (no pun intended) boosted tourism to South Korea, with a 2017 Korea Tourism Organization survey finding that roughly half of foreign tourists in South Korea decided to visit the country after watching Korean dramas and films. Filming locations of hit K-dramas have become popular tourist destinations in South Korea. And it seems the global popularity of K-dramas will only continue to grow. Currently, K-dramas on Netflix are dubbed and subbed in over 30 languages, including English, German, French, Swedish, Hindi, Portuguese, and Bahasa Indonesia. The entertainment powerhouse announced earlier this year that it is investing $500 million in Korean content in 2021. Apple TV+ and Disney+ are following suit, with the former adding at least two of its original K-dramas, Dr. Brain and Pachinko, later this year, and the latter working with local producers to create more Korean content.
